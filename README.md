### Links

- Live Site URL: https://parradaniela.github.io/frontendmentor-2/

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Nothing much to say, just some practice to get back into writing code after a couple of weeks away. It was good to review flexbox as well as the object-fit property for images. I appreciated the opportunity to research how to create this button design (using pixel values in object-radius instead of % values) as I think it's a pretty commonly-used design. 

### Continued development

Curious about how to do this in CSS grid, eventually I would like to try to learn that option as well.
